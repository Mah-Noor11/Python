# defining a functions
# we used def for defining a function and with this we also mention function name 
# def print_codanics():
#     print("we are learning with codanics")
#     print("we are learning with codanics")
#     print("we are learning with codanics")

# print_codanics()
# anither way to define function
# def print_codanics():
#     text = "we are learning with codanics youtube chanel"
#     print(text)
#     print(text)
#     print(text)
# print_codanics()


# 3rd method of defining code
# def print_codanics(text):
#     print(text)
#     print(text)
#     print(text)
# print_codanics("we are learning")

#4th method with if, elif, else statement

# def school_calculator(age, text):
#     if age==5:
#      print("ali can join the school")
#     elif age <5:
#        print("ali cannot join the school")
#     elif age >= 5:
#        print("ali can join higher standard school")
#     else:
#        print("ali is not eligible ")
   
# school_calculator(3, "ali")

#define future function

def future_fun(age):
    new_age = age+20
    return new_age
    print(new_age)
future_predicted_age=future_fun(18)
print(future_predicted_age)
