# print(we are learn)  # this s called syntax error so we need to put commas " like this"

# print(25/0) # it's called zero_division_error (but it's real name is runtime error)

name = "Mhnoor"
# print("helo name")  # if we write like this it only shows us "hello name "(this typ eof error called "symentic error which is very dificult to find")
#this type of error shows us it's our mistake bcz we did'nt know how to write

# so we write this line in a correct wa which is :
# print("Hello", name)   
# also write like this when we have no need of any space
print("Hello"+name)
